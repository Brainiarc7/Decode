#Decode 2.0
I rebuilt Decode based on the great theme foundation, Underscores. I built it mobile first, and used media queries to bring in CSS for larger screens. 

One should note that some parts of the theme, namely the `header.php` file have a few items hardcoded in, so before using this theme on a blog of your own, you should change that file however you like. 

My version of Underscores also supports link posts, where the title can be hyperlinked. To do this, first set the post format to "Link" and then add designate where the title should link to using a custom field entitled, `title_url`, `url_title`, or `url1`. I also have added support for quote posts. Quote marks are automatically added, so don't use them when composing a quote.
