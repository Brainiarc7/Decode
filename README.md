#Decode 2.2
I built Decode, the theme I use on [Beyond The Code](http://beyondtheco.de), on the great theme foundation, [Underscores](http://underscores.me). I built it for mobile first, and used media queries to bring in CSS for larger screens. 

Decode supports link posts, where the title can be hyperlinked. To do this, first set the post format to "Link" and then add designate where the title should link to using a custom field entitled, `title_url`, `url_title`, or `url1`. I also have added support for quote posts. Quote marks are automatically added, so don't use them when composing a quote.

Decode's elegant sidebar is conveniently accessed by clicking or tapping on the much-loved hamburger icon. The sidebar can hold any number of widgets you choose. The side on which the sidebar and the hamburger icon are placed is customizable. You can also disable the sidebar if you choose.

Decode also has a nifty built in reply tool that lets readers send you a reply about the post using Twitter or App.net. This can, of course, be turned off in the Customize menu. 

Lastly, Decode has social icons in the header that can link to your Twitter, App.net, Facebook, or Google+ profile. These can be configured in the Customize menu as well. 


*Currently, the sidebar may not be able to be dismissed after the inital install. This may be remedied by using the theme customize menu to toggle the Show Sidebar preference.*
