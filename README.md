#Decode 2.1
I rebuilt Decode based on the great theme foundation, Underscores. I built it mobile first, and used media queries to bring in CSS for larger screens. 

My version of Underscores also supports link posts, where the title can be hyperlinked. To do this, first set the post format to "Link" and then add designate where the title should link to using a custom field entitled, `title_url`, `url_title`, or `url1`. I also have added support for quote posts. Quote marks are automatically added, so don't use them when composing a quote.
